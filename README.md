## 📌 Project Overview

The Grocery Store Management System is a SQL-based project designed to efficiently manage and analyze core business operations such as products, customers, suppliers, employees, orders, and inventory.
It simulates a real-world retail environment where relational database design and SQL queries are used to extract valuable business insights.

This project showcases practical use of database design, joins, aggregations, window functions, and performance optimization techniques.

---

 ## 🎯 Objectives
- **Design and implement** a well-structured relational database that accurately represents the operations of a grocery store.
- **Retrieve, update, and manage data** efficiently using SQL commands and queries.
- **Analyze business performance** by identifying top customers, best-selling products, and overall revenue trends.
- **Apply advanced SQL concepts** such as joins, subqueries, aggregations, and filtering to solve real-world data problems.
- **Develop data-driven insights** to support better decision-making and improve store management efficiency.

## 🗂️ Database Structure
The database includes 7 interrelated tables:


| Table Name        | Description                                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Supplier**      | Stores supplier names and addresses.                                |
| **Categories**    | Defines product categories (e.g., Dairy, Snacks, Household).        |
| **Employees**     | Stores employee details and hire dates.                             |
| **Customers**     | Contains customer information and addresses.                        |
| **Products**      | Contains product name, price, category, and supplier details.       |
| **Orders**        | Records customer order details including employee who processed it. |
| **Order_Details** | Contains line items for each order, including quantity and price.   |

## 🧩 Note on Table Creation and Data Import

When building the database, it’s best to **create tables and import data step by step** rather than executing the entire SQL script at once.

#### 💡 Why Follow This Approach?

If you run all table creation scripts together, tools like **MySQL Workbench** automatically list tables **alphabetically** in the schema view.
While convenient, this can make it difficult to understand the actual data flow and dependencies because:

* The **logical sequence** of relationships (e.g., *Supplier → Products → Orders*) is lost.
* **Foreign key references** become harder to trace.
* **Beginners may struggle** to understand or debug table dependencies and joins.

#### ✅ Recommended Logical Order

To maintain a clear and structured workflow, create and load data in the following order:

1. **Supplier** → Base table for product sourcing
2. **Categories** → Defines product grouping
3. **Employees** → Stores employee details
4. **Customers** → Contains customer data
5. **Products** → Depends on supplier and category
6. **Orders** → Depends on customer and employee
7. **Order_Details** → Depends on orders and products

Following this order ensures that **foreign key relationships are valid**, **data integrity is maintained**, and **troubleshooting becomes easier** throughout development and testing.

### 2. Product Performance
- How many products exist in each category?
- What is the average price of products by category?
- Which products have the highest total sales volume (by quantity)?
- What is the total revenue generated by each product?
- How do product sales vary by category and supplier?

### 3. Sales and Order Trends
- How many orders have been placed in total?
- What is the average value per order?
- On which dates were the most orders placed?
- What are the monthly trends in order volume and revenue?
- How do order patterns vary across weekdays and weekends?

### 4. Supplier Contribution
- How many suppliers are there in the database?
- Which supplier provides the most products?
- What is the average price of products from each supplier?
- Which suppliers contribute the most to total product sales (by revenue)?

### 5. Employee Performance

## 📈 Key Insights & Recommendations

- **Almost  80% of customers purchase multiple quantities**, suggesting higher order value and customer satisfaction.
- **Top 5 customers** contribute the most to **store’s total revenue**, each spending between **₹9,000 and ₹11,500**.
- The **Household category** has only **3 products** but a **higher average price**, suggesting potential for profit growth if expanded.
- Products like **Bath soap, Hand sanitizer, Dishwashing soaps, Potato chips, and Biscuits have high sales by quantity**, requiring consistent inventory maintenance.
- Higher sales in certain months **(e.g., January and December)** may be due to the festive season.
- **Two suppliers** together contribute **60% of the store’s total revenue**, indicating that a majority of sales come from a small number of key suppliers.
- **Two employees** together handled **75 out of 300 total orders**, indicating a need for better work distribution among the team.
